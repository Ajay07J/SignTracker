# Testing Authentication - Verification Guide

## ðŸ§ª How to Test the Fixed Authentication System

Follow these steps to verify everything is working correctly:

### Step 1: Verify Database Setup
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Run the complete SQL from `SUPABASE_SETUP_FIXED.md`
4. Check that all tables were created without errors

### Step 2: Test Admin User Creation
1. Start your application: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the signup page
3. Create a user with these details:
   ```
   Full Name: Test Admin
   Email: admin@test.com
   Employee Code: 0001
   Password: password123
   ```
4. Complete signup and login

### Step 3: Verify Admin User in Database
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Database â†’ users table
2. You should see a new record with:
   - `email`: admin@test.com
   - `employee_code`: 0001
   - `is_admin`: true âœ…
   - `full_name`: Test Admin

### Step 4: Test Regular User Creation
1. Sign out from the admin account
2. Create another user:
   ```
   Full Name: Regular User
   Email: user@test.com
   Employee Code: 1234
   Password: password123
   ```
3. Complete signup and login

### Step 5: Verify Regular User in Database
1. Check the users table again
2. The new record should have:
   - `email`: user@test.com
   - `employee_code`: 1234
   - `is_admin`: false âœ…
   - `full_name`: Regular User

### Step 6: Test Admin Functionality
1. Login as the admin user (admin@test.com)
2. You should see an "Admin Panel" button in the dashboard
3. Regular users should NOT see this button

### Step 7: Test Document Creation
1. As any user, click "New Document"
2. Fill out the form and upload a test file
3. Select the admin user as an approver
4. Submit the document

### Step 8: Test Admin Approval
1. Login as admin user
2. Go to Admin Panel
3. You should see the pending document
4. Approve or reject it
5. Verify status changes correctly

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "User profile not found" error
**Solution**: The database trigger might not be working
- Check if the trigger function was created correctly
- Verify the trigger is active in Database â†’ Functions

### Issue 2: Admin users not getting admin access
**Solution**: Check employee code validation
- Ensure you're using exactly: 0001, 0002, 0003, or 0004
- Leading zeros are important!

### Issue 3: Authentication errors
**Solution**: Check environment variables
- Verify `.env` file has correct Supabase URL and anon key
- Restart development server after changes

### Issue 4: File upload issues
**Solution**: Check storage bucket
- Ensure 'documents' bucket exists
- Verify storage policies are applied

## âœ… Expected Behavior

### Signup Flow:
1. User fills signup form
2. Supabase Auth creates auth user
3. Database trigger automatically creates profile
4. Admin codes 0001-0004 get `is_admin = true`
5. User redirected to dashboard

### Login Flow:
1. User enters credentials
2. Auth checks credentials
3. Profile fetched from users table
4. Dashboard shows appropriate permissions

### Admin Features:
- Admin Panel access
- Document approval capabilities
- Can update external signer status

### Regular User Features:
- Create documents
- View all documents
- Update external signer status for own documents

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

âœ… Admin users can be created through signup (no SQL needed)
âœ… Regular users get appropriate permissions
âœ… Document workflow functions correctly
âœ… All database operations work without RLS errors
âœ… File uploads work properly

If all tests pass, your authentication system is working perfectly!
